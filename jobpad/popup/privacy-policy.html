<p>
	We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site&rsquo;s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>
	18. Compliance with Law Enforcement.</p>
<p>
	As indicated above, we will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of our company or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
<p>
	19. Email Referrals</p>
<p>
	If you choose to use our email referral services to tell a friend about our products or services we will ask you for your friend&#39;s name and email address. We will use that information to send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site and review the product or service you have selected. We may use a third-party provider to administer this function, but any such third-party provider may only use the information submitted to facilitate this one-time email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	20. Phishing</p>
<p>
	Identity theft and the practice currently known as &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>
	21.&nbsp; Further Data Collection</p>
<p>
	We may collect aggregate (general tracking) information about pages that users visit on our site. We also may collect user specific information about pages that users visit on our site. Any information that you give us when you complete a contact form or inquiry form, survey and so forth are temporarily collected by us as explained herein.</p>
<p>
	22. Selling Behavior</p>
<p>
	If you choose to buy or sell on our Site, we collect information about your buying and selling behavior. This information is only used for statistical and website development purposes.</p>
<p>
	23. Foreign Data Storage of Private Information</p>
<p>
	Your information may be transferred to &mdash; and maintained on &mdash; computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we transfer Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
<p>
	24. Third Party Links.&nbsp; Pages through our Service (the &ldquo;Submissions&rdquo;), contain links to, and may allow you to visit, other websites (&ldquo;Third Party Sites&rdquo;). If you choose to visit any of these Third Party Sites by &ldquo;clicking on&rdquo; another third party link or navigating to a Third Party Site, you will be directed to that third party&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>
	25.&nbsp; Changes to this Policy</p>
<p>
	We reserve the right to change the terms of this privacy policy at any time with no prior notice. When we make changes, we will revise the &quot;last updated&quot; date at the top of the policy. Please review this policy each time you visit our site or use any tool or service that we provide.</p>
